## About Me
I'm a PhD candidate at King's College London working on optimal design of experiments for functional data. My research combines ideas from classical design theory, stochastic processes, and modern computational statistics.

Outside of academia, I have worked at **Johnson & Johnson (Belgium)** as a statistician intern, and held analyst and finance roles at **Blueground (Greece)**. I'm passionate about applying statistical methods to real-world decision-making and building tools that are both elegant and rigorous.
